          Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is
          available for
          Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich
          ecosystem
          of extensions for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET).

    <section id="Installation">
      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <article>
        <ol>
          <li>Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows.</li>
          <li>Once it is downloaded, run the installer (VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe). This will only take a minute.
          </li>
          <li>By default, VS Code is installed under C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>Tip:</b> Setup will add Visual Studio Code to your %PATH%, so from the console you can type 'code .' to
          open VS Code on that
          folder. You will need to restart your console after the installation for the change to the %PATH%
          environmental variable
          to take effect.</p>

        </p>
        <p>At its heart, Visual Studio Code is a code editor. Like many other code editors, VS Code adopts a common user
          interface
          and layout of an explorer on the left, showing all of the files and folders you have access to, and an editor
          on the
          right, showing the content of the files you have opened.<br>
          VS Code comes with a simple and intuitive layout that maximizes the space provided for the editor while
          leaving ample
          room to browse and access the full context of your folder or project. The UI is divided into five areas:<br>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Editor -</b> The main area to edit your files. You can open as many editors as you like side by side
            vertically and
            horizontally.</li>
          <li><b>Side Bar -</b> Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project.
          </li>
          <li><b>Status Bar -</b> Information about the opened project and the files you edit.</li>
          <li><b>Activity Bar -</b> Located on the far left-hand side, this lets you switch between views and gives you
            additional
            context-specific indicators, like the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled.</li>
          <li><b>Panels -</b> You can display different panels below the editor region for output or debug information,
            errors and warnings,
            or an integrated terminal. Panel can also be moved to the right for more vertical space.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Visual Studio Code for the Web provides a free, zero-install Microsoft Visual Studio Code experience running
          entirely in your browser, allowing you to quickly and safely browse source code repositories and make
          lightweight code
          changes. Toget started, go to <b>vscode.dev</b> in your browser.<br><br>
          VS Code for the Web has many of the features of VS Code desktop that you love, including search and syntax
          highlighting
          while browsing and editing, along with extension support to work on your codebase and make simpler edits. In
          addition to
          opening repositories, forks, and pull requests from source control providers like GitHub and Azure Repos (in
          preview),
          you can also work with code that is stored on your local machine.<br><br>

          VS Code for the Web runs entirely in your web browser, so there are certain limitations compared to the
          desktop
          experience, which you can read more about below.

          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!</p>
        <p>
          By navigating to <b>https://vscode.dev</b>, you can create a new local file or project, work on an existing
          local project, or
          access source code repositories hosted elsewhere, such as on GitHub and Azure Repos (part of Azure DevOps).

          You can navigate to a project repository directly from a URL, following the
          scheme: <b>https://vscode.dev/SOURCE/ORG/REPO.</b>
          Using the VS Code repo as an example, this would look like: <b>https://vscode.dev/github/microsoft/vscode.</b>

          To work with both GitHub and Azure Repos, VSâ€¯Code for the Web supports two routes, vscode.dev/github and
          vscode.dev/azurerepos:

          GitHub: <b>https://vscode.dev/github/organization/repo</b>

          Azure Repos: <b>https://vscode.dev/azurerepos/organization/project/repo</b>

          If you're already in VS Code for the Web at <b>https://vscode.dev</b>, you can alternatively navigate to
          different
          repos via
          the GitHub Repositories extension commands. Select the remote indicator in the lower left of the Status bar,
          and you'll
          be presented with the Open Remote Repository... command.
